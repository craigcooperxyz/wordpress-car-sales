# Wordpress Car Sales
This plugin adds custom post types to Wordpress for the purpose of car sales listings on Wordpress.

## What it does
It adds a custom post type called 'cars' to your Wordpress install along with custom taxonomies and custom fields for your car listings. It doesn't include any templates to display cars for sale in the front end. 

You need to create these two files in your theme along with the custom fields or taxonomies that you wish to display:

- single-car.php
- archive-car.php

In order to display the list of cars and the individual cars for sale.

### Custom taxonomies

Coming soon a list of all the custom taxonomies used in the plugin to help to organise the cars.

### Custom field IDs

Coming soon a list of all the custom fields used in the plugin that you can call in the template to display them.
